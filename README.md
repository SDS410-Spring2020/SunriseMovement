This study explores the reach of the Sunrise Movement 2019 Fall Field Program. The program was based at college campuses in Pennsylvania, Iowa and New Hampshire, asking people to pledge to vote in the special election in 2019 in Pennsylvania, or in the Democratic Primary in Iowa and New Hampshire. This study sought to find insight surrounding the demographics of the individuals reached through this program. Here we show that the voters reached were less racially diverse than would be expected based on the demographics of the colleges. We also find that out-of-state student voters detracted from the impact of the field program. This study illuminates the lack of diversity among the voters who were reached in this field program. We recommend considering information about colleges, such as type of school, racial diversity, and numbers of in-state vs. out-of-state students. These results should provide insight into how to improve the structure of future field programs to maximize the use of resources and to align with the goals of the Sunrise Movement as an organization.
